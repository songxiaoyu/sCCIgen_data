\arguments{
\item{ppp.obj}{An object of class "ppp" representing simulated cell locations}

\item{sim.count}{Simulated expression counts from single-cell expression
data, before adding in additional spatial patterns.}

\item{r}{Which region to add in the spatial pattern. If simulated data do
not have multiple regions, r=1.}

\item{perturbed.cell.type}{Which cell type is perturbed from this cell-cell
interaction (e.g. microglia).}

\item{adjacent.cell.type}{Which cell type in the neighbor perturbs from
the cell-cell interaction (e.g. neuron).}

\item{int.dist.threshold}{The minimal cell-cell distance for the interaction.}

\item{delta.mean}{Expected effect.size (at the log scale of the counts).}

\item{delta.sd}{Standard deviation of the effect.size}

\item{GeneID}{Affected genes.}

\item{PropOfGenes}{Proportion of genes impacted by the cell-cell interaction.
It is used if GenePairIDMatrix is NULL, and a random subset of genes with
specified proportion will be perturbed.}

\item{seed}{Seed}
}
\value{
\item{SignalSummary:}{Summary of this spatial pattern, including the type
of spatial patterns, impacted cell types, perturbed genes, and effect sizes.}
\item{beta.matrix:}{Effect size on each gene in each cell. }

\description{
This function add a type of cell-cell interactions to a pair of cell types:
the expression in a cell type associated with the proximity of
the other cell type. One can repeat this function for multiple times to
add cell-cell interactions for many cell type pairs and regions.
